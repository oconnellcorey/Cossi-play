<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Corey.oconnell<br>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The goal for the website is to reach a younger generation of cosplayers and improve the customer base for cossiplay. This will be done by attempting to appeal to the younger generation of consumer, building consumer awareness that the product is available to them and generating a need for new costumes through the parties.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> The success of the website will be measured by whether or not the company sees a measurable rise in costumes sales and party attendance. We know that at the moment the company is making 4 costumes a week and around 30 people a month are attending the parties. We would measure the numbers against the number of costumes sales and party attendance in proceeding months we would test the success of the website over the next 5 months to rule out any anomalies that are not linked to the site such as movies releases were customers might order extra costumes. </p>
