<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The goal for the website is to reach a younger generation of cosplayers and improve the customer base for cossiplay. This will be done by attempting to appeal to the younger generation of consumer, building consumer awareness that the product is available to them and generating a need for new costumes through the parties.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> The success of the website will be measured by whether or not the company sees a measurable rise in costumes sales and party attendance. We know that at the moment the company is making 4 costumes a week and around 30 people a month are attending the parties. We would measure the numbers against the number of costumes sales and party attendance in proceeding months we would test the success of the website over the next 5 months to rule out any anomalies that are not linked to the site such as movies releases were customers might order extra costumes. </p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>At the moment cossiplay brings in customers (cosplayers) of all ages, but mostly they are 35 – 50 taking in to account that the monthly party’s an 18+ event it is safe to say that cossiplay would like to attract customers from 18-30. Some ways the site will attract younger customers is to use bolder brighter colours and concepts in the design process, it will need to use modern designs that draw the focus straight to the point, young people generally don’t like to do too much reading and they want to find what they are looking for right away or they will normally move on to the next site. Taking this into account the site will need a powerful call to action in order to draw them in. As well as this the site will use younger people in the image content and show them having a great time. Whilst the site will need to be bold and exiting it also can’t be to over crowed or have too much going on at once.  In conclusion the new site will be bright and colourful but also modern and contemporary with straight lines and sharp edges to draw the eye straight to what really matters.</p>
